**Instructions:**

1. **Setup MongoDB:**

   - Install MongoDB locally or create a free cluster on MongoDB Atlas.
   - Start the MongoDB server locally or connect to the MongoDB Atlas cluster.
   - Verify the installation and connection by running:
     ```sh
     mongo --version

2. **Running the DB**

    - Open your Mongosh in Mongodb Compass or Mongosh (if it's standalone) and paste your connection string to connect. Run 'use Library'. This will create the library db for you.
    - Copy and paste the queries in 'mongodb_Practice.js' from line 5 to populate the data into the db. Use the comments to understand what the query does. 
    - Copy from where the comment ends all the way to when the next command starts. e.g., copy from end of line 4 till start of line 43 for your first query.
    - Watch the results appear on your shell with joy!
